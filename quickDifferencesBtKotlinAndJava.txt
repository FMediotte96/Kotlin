Differences between Kotlin and Java

1. In Kotlin we don't use anymore semicolon (;)
2. The Kotlin standard library has lot of wrappers
3. Kotlin has the notion of hard keywords and soft keywords:
    hard keywords are like in Java
    soft keywords can be used in other place like as a variable name
4. In Kotlin we can use square brackets to access elements in collections
5. Kotlin has its own String class: https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/
6. Kotlin doesn't distinguish between checked and unchecked exceptions, in fact the throw keyword doesn't exist in
   Kotlin. All exceptions are unchecked so we don't have to declare them
7. In Kotlin the ternary operator doesn't exists
8. The normal for(int i = 0; ...) loop doesn't exists in Kotlin
9. Kotlin doesn't have a static keyword, they are replaced by a top-level function so the concept of static
   is still there
10. In Kotlin there isn't the new keyword
